File format
===========

Salt files are recipes describing processing operations, i.e. they do not contain image data. They are serialised as YAML 1.1 files.

Example
-------

The folowing is a minimal recipe that reads one of two files, debayers it in a raw converter and the outputs the result both in a viewer and through a FileOutput.

.. code-block:: yaml

    version: 0.1.0
    operators:
        my_file_input:
            name: My file input
            type: FileInput
            files:
                - /path/to/file.iiq
                - /path/to/other/file.tif
            current_file: 0

        my_raw_converter:
            name: My RAW converter
            type: RawConverter
            # connect the data input to `my_file_input`'s data output
            inputs:
                data: my_file_input.data

        my_viewer:
            name: My viewer
            type: Viewer
            inputs:
                data: my_raw_converter.data

        my_file_output:
            name: My file output
            type: FileOutput
            inputs:
                data: my_raw_converter.data
            filename: /output/path/file.tif
            format_options:
                compression: zip
            color_space: Adobe RGB (1998)

Top-level structure
-------------------

Version - ``version``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every recipe must contain the version of Salt it was created with. Stable versions of Salt will be guaranteed to be able to read recipes generated by older stable versions of Salt (exact compatibility rules are TBD).

Operator list - ``operators``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The core of the recipe is a map from operator IDs to their definitions.

Operator definitions
--------------------

The schema for each operator is defined along with the reference for its model (to-do: insert link to operator reference).
